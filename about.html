    <p>I am currently a student in the digital media program at Polk State College. I am eager to learn and grow as an artist and designer. I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion for creativity and storytelling. I feel that collaboration and community are the key to creating a sense of purpose and belonging. I am beyond excited to become a true part of the digital media community!</p>
